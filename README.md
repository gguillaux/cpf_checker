## CPF Composition
The CPF is composed by 11 digits that are build accordingly the below logic:
* The first **9 digits** are the actual numbers that compose the CPF code
* The last **2 digits** are used to verify the 9 first numbers.

The last 2 digits are obtained by:
1. **First digit**: sum of the product of each digit by its index, starting with 1.
   * For example, if we have have a CPF = 123.456.789 we should do: sum(1 * 1, 2 * 2, ... , 9 * 9)
   * The sum should be divided by 11 and the remainder part should be yield as the first digit
2. **Second digit**: sum of the product of each digit by its reverse index, starting with 9.
   * For example, if we have have a CPF = 123.456.789 we should do: sum(1 * 9, 2 * 8, ... , 9 * 1)
   * The sum should be divided by 11 and the remainder part should be yield as the second digit
